# Calorie_cal

# Overview

This is a project for the first time creating an Android application using Android Studio

The app is for the purpose of monitoring one's calorie intake as well as managing a grocery list. 
There is also a diary entry where the user can add anything to their mind for convenience.

This project is to understand how to create an Android app and learn its ins and outs.
